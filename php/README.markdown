# A Pacman game in Scalable Vector Graphics #

This game has been built by Johan Hasselqvist (Hasselmannen) being tutored by Lars Gunther (itpastorn).

It is a simple Pacman game made in SVG and JavaScript.

 * You steer using the arrow keys.
 * When eating the big dots the ghosts become edible.
 * After some time a cherry appears that you can eat.
 * There is only one level. You either make it or don't.

## Demo project for Skolverket ##

Since Lars was a consultant for Skolverket, Sweden's National Agency of Education, this game (in an early incarnation)
was used to demonstrate a suitable final project for IT-students at the secondary school level (approximately senior high).
